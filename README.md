## 🌟 Hey, welcome to my GitHub!
So glad you dropped by 👋

I’m someone who enjoys working with data, learning through real projects, and turning confusion into clarity (one SQL query at a time).     
On this page, you’ll find:
- 📊 A Power BI dashboard I’ve built to tell better data stories
- 🏗️ A SQL data warehouse project where I played architect and analyst
- 🧠 SQL based exploratory analysis that helped me dig into trends and patterns

I’m currently exploring the world of data analysis and working toward landing a full-time role. This space is kind of like my learning journal, portfolio, and playground - all rolled into one.

Whether you’re here to learn, collaborate, or just curious - thanks for stopping by!  

Let’s grow together 🚀
